# ToAffinityAndBeyond
"To Affinity And Beyond" forces a predefined list of processes to their specified CPU Affinity.

If you have a few application that that you want to run on different CPU cores, you can specify the Process title and Affinity.
Setting the Affinity will set it to the specified core you want the process to run on. This is ideal if you wan to restrict 
a specific application to only use a certain core/cores, to make sure that resources are available for whatever else you want to run.

This program was inspired by the frustration of managing Ark Survival Evolved Servers with limited hardware and management tools that
don't work as well as the creators beleive it does. 

If you find this program usefull, please consider donating. Every little bit helps in the long run.
